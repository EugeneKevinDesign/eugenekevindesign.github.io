					The future of iPhone lies in the unification of the iOS experience. iOS 10 has paved the way for new interactions between apps, but iOS Fuji takes it even further. With new capabilities for Siri, a centralization of data in some core iOS apps such as Messages or Contacts, and much more, iOS Fuji promises to deliver a unique and promising experience for future iOS users.

		    			Siri Panel is a new way of using apps with your smartphone, designed to ease multitasking. The things that you do get stacked in a linear flow, where apps appear as minimalist versions called Siri Cards. Siri Panel has been thought to be used with voice and touch inputs at the same time, but it can adapt and be used with touch gestures only as well.

If the contact is online in multiple services, it uses the priority list that has been setup at the first bootup of the app. All of this happens under the hood; the user only cares about delivering his message to his contact. Also, if the user taps on the name of the app, he can open the corresponding conversation in the dedicated app.

					iOS Fuji and iOS Fuji 2.0 are concepts entirely made by me. I see iOS Fuji 2.0 as an evolution of iOS Fuji (which can be found here <a href="https://eugenekevin.github.io">eugenekevin.github.io</a>). In a sense, version 2.0 is where I wanted to take the concept in the first place, which really was not about the Pickpad, but about productivity. Everything that was in the initial concept (Pickpad, Cards version 1, Music, etc) that is not here has been dumped (except for The Small Things which should be published again soon in a better version). I made these concepts for fun with passion and love, because I wanted to share with the world some of my ideas. No commercial purposes are intended. This website is a tribute to Apple's famous designs, and should not be seen as a counterfeit or a pale imitation. Making something new while respecting Apple's aesthetics codes, for the website as well for the concept itself, was really challenging. iOS, iPhone, macOS, Mac, Continuity, 3D Touch, etc. are trademarks that belong to Apple. Thanks to Simon Mettler, Pham Thi Dieu Linh, David Pareja, Zachary Bogard, Akshay Kore, Marie Van den Broeck, Marcio Duarte, and Marek Polavic for the icons they designed and that I used for the purpose of this website. And also, many thanks to the designers of sketchappsources.com for building graphical resources from the iOS GUI that I used and built upon for my concept. The sketches have been designed using Sketch, and the animations using Principle.
